Plot extends 30 m to either side of stream. The narrow riparian strip (10-20 in wide) is bordered by residential property for the lower 100 m and by fallow fig/walnut orchard for an additional 250 m. The remaining 1930 m grades away from the stream into mostly undisturbed native bay-oak woodland, which comprises much of the plot. There is one residence and several small water treatment buildings above the orchard and a dirt road follows the creek through about half of the plot. Stream fiow is regulated by a 100-year old darn upstream of the plot and some fiow is present at all times. A quantitative vegetation survey was conducted following a modified version of the method described by James and Shugart (1970. Aud.Field Notes 24:727-736). Tree diameters (26 cm; n = 410) were measured in 30 evenly spaced 0.04 ha (60 X 6.6 In) rectangles situated perpendicularly to the stream fiow. Total tree density 342/ha, total basal area 99 mZ/ha.

Ecological succession over 86 years has produced a nearly mature riparian deciduous forest on the site, now protected by the Toledo Area Metroparks. The vegetation study was conducted in early August, 1988, a year before bird censuses were initiated. Since the plot is long and narrow, transects were run at right angles to the long axis of the plot at 100-m intervals. There were 16 transects in all; the length of each was 30 m. All trees within 10 m and all shrubs/ saplings within 5 m of each transect were counted and the relative abundance of each species recorded as a percentage of the total number of trees and shrubs/saplings counted. Herbaceous vegetation cover was determined by estimating the percent cover of each species in a l-m2 circle located every 6 m along each transect. Thus, there were 5 sample circles per transect, and 80 (5 X 16) sample circles in all. Sometimes the sum of the percent cover values exceeded 100% for a circle because of vertical overlap of the leaves of different species. When this occurred the percentages were reduced proportionally to bring the sum for each circle down to 100%. Percent cover values for each species were summed over all sample circles and divided by 80; thus data for all 3 layers of vegetation may be considered to express percent relative abundances. Relative abundance (%) is given after each species name: (trees 2 15 cm) Boxelder, 13.8; American Basswood, 11.9; Hackberry, 10.8; Black Walnut, 9.7; Eastern Cottonwood, 9.0; American Elm, 8.8; Eastern Redbud, 6.8; Honeylocust, 6.6; Green Ash, 6.6; hawthorn, 3.4; Sycamore, 2.2; Ohio Buckeye, 1.8; Black Ash, 1.7; 11 other species, 6.8.

The forest is second growth oak and Red Maple that grew in after farm land was abandoned about 60 yr ago. The plot is a portion of a 27 ha reserve owned by the University of Rhode Island, and situated amidst a landscape dominated by residential development. Much of the remainder of the forest consists of a Red Pine plantation. Additional plantings of non-native trees occur on the plot, the largest being a 0.3 ha Red Pine planting. Red Maple occurs mostly as a subcanopy or as smaller sized trees. Substantial numbers of oaks, in a band across the center of the plot have been killed by Gypsy Moths, resulting in a relatively open canopy. Additional canopy openings occur at two small ponds on the W side of the plot. These kettleholes both contained water during the census period. The understory is largely dominated by dense growth of bullbrier (Smilax sp.). A trail bisects the plot from the center of its N boundary to the SW corner.

The site came under the management of the Ohio Chapter of The Nature Conservancy in 1990. The vegetation was quantified using plant frequency sampling. Eight transects were established at 100-m intervals, and a 0.5 m2 quadrat sample was taken at 10-m intervals along each transect. Species occurring in 15% or more of the sample quadrats include [values represent percent frequency of occurrence]: Bromus inermix 38%; Pastinaca sativa, Agropyron repens 29%; Phleum praiense 26%; Ambrosia artemisz'z'folia, Convolvulus repium, Daucus admin 22%; Dactylis glomerata, Trifolium pratense 21%; Andropogon gerardi 17%; Aster sp., Sorghastrum nutans 15%.

The forest consists of densely-spaced trees, mainly of larger size. Beech dominates on the lower (E) side of the plot, and oaks and White Pine on the higher elevations to the W. Ground cover and shrubs are rather sparse except on the steeper E side and around canopy openings. Many older oaks on the W half of the plot were killed during the 1983 Gypsy Moth outbreak, resulting in numerous openings. An ephemeral stream arises near the center of the plot and runs NE. The plot receives very light recreational use, mostly confined to the E portion in association with an old campsite, but no trails cross the plot. A quantitative vegetation survey based on the method described by EC. James & H.H. Shugart, Jr. (1970. Aud.

Shrubs include wild red raspberry, water-willow, and buttonbush. Canopy cover measured in 1992 was 3%, based on 10 vegetation profile readings above 2 m at each of 20 sampling points. The ground cover estimate was 83.5%, based on readings below 1 m. Vegetation profile estimates in 1992, based on 10 line intersect readings at each of 20 sampling points were: <05 m, 74%; 0.5-1 m, 56%; 12 m, 20%; 2-5 m, 3%, >5 In, 0.5%. The number of shrub stems/ha in 1993, based on counts in 10, 1x10 m quadrats was 28,300 compared Mth 24,000 in 1991. Size class distribution: <05 m, 18,600; 0.5-1 m, 8200; 1-2 m, 1300; >2 m, 200 (compared with 10,200; 12,600; 1100; 0 in 1991). Shrub species in order of total abundance: wild red raspberry 15,000 stems <0.5 111, 6800 stems 0.5-1 m, 300 stems 1-2 m, 0 stems >2 m; water-willow 2800, 400, 0, 0; riverbank grape 800, 800, 300, 0; buttonbush 0, 200, 500, 100; sweetbrier 0, 0, 400, 0; tamarack 0, 0, 0, 100. Significant changes from 1991 include an increase in the abundance of wild red raspberry (from 11,100 to 22,100 stems/ha), and a decrease in the abundance of water-willow (10,200 to 3200). This decrease in water-willow can be partly accounted for by seasonal differences; in 1993 the stems were counted earlier in a cooler year than in 1991. Changes of 5% or more between 1992 and 1993 in the mean estimated cover for ground layer species, based on 10, 1x1 m quadrats include a 94% increase in tussock sedge, and large increases in the cover of mosses and lichens."

A seed-tree cut was performed in 1981. Scattered remnant loblolly pine trees were left standing for reseeding the site.

The young trees currently form a low, thick canopy. A hardwood inclusion, dominated by understory-sized water oaks, is located in the N section of the plot.
