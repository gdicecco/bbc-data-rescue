The pdf form for the BBC data files should be placed in this directory using the
naming convention `BBC<year>.pdf` where `<year>` is replaced with the year of
the data. E.g., `BBC1990.pdf`.

The code is currently designed to take the data starting on the first data page,
which in many versions of the BBC data are the tabular summaries. The tabular
summaries are then stripped out by the code. To avoid skipping data the pdfs
added to this directory should follow this convention. E.g., the 1998 data
starts on page 22 of Volume 60, No. 1 of Journal of Field Ornithology (Winter
1989).

We would like to include the pdfs in this repository, but because they are
published in non-open access journals we cannot redistribute them.
